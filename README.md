# UROP2019-CochlearImplants  
The aim of the project was to develop a device to emulate what a person with a cochlear implant hears. Through a surgically implanted neuroprosthetic, such devices provide the sense of sound to patients with a pronounced hearing disability. These are already used but their current performance in not nearly as good as the natural human hearing.

The MATLAB GUI that was implemented is useful to demonstrate the significance behind the use of cochlear implants, as well as showing how important it is for research to make further developments in the technology, that at present is not even close to being optimal.
